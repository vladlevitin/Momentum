[![Coverage](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/programvareutvikling-v19/gruppe-34/badges/tests_for_users/coverage.svg)](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/programvareutvikling-v19/gruppe-34/-/jobs)

**Momentum makes it possible for Startups, Investors and private users 
to get in touch with each other.**

The webapp provides this through an integrated job application system, simple site navigation and a 
front page for promoting content from the Startup community. The webapp has a lot of potential for 
further development and personalization.

Momentum is created using Django v2.1.7, Python v3.5 and an SQLite 3 database. The team has used the Python IDE PyCharm for development.

The repository can be found [here](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/programvareutvikling-v19/gruppe-34/). 


## Install in your virtualenv (venv)
```bash
$ pip install django-crispy-forms
$ pip install Pillow
$ pip install googlemaps
$ pip install django-geoposition
$ pip install django-bootstrap3
```

The current Google Maps API key has been generated by the Momentum Team 
and is available for all to use as of April 2019. It is recommended that
developer teams generate their own API keys.

## Instructions for running project
Assuming Django v2.1.7 installed and that superuser has not been generated.


Clone project from GitLab:
```bash
$ git clone https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/programvareutvikling-v19/gruppe-34.git
```

If you wish to run the project with some data on the webapp, the
following is recommended:
```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py loaddata testdb.json 
$ python manage.py runserver
```

This will generate a superuser, some profiles and front page content.
Log in to admin with username and password "admin". You can also log 
into Revolve (Startup) with username "revolve" and password "heiheihei".

If you want to run the project with no data, remember to create superuser before migrating.
Log in to main page with superuser before running admin page for proper profile setup.

````bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
````

Development server will run at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.


## Instructions for testing, CI and pipelines in GitLab
1. With the commit f7cd3d5 in the pipeline_activation branch, Continuous
    Integration and Pipelines are now activated.
2. These pipelines will run jobs configured in the .gitlab-ci.yml file.
3. It is by March 14 configured only to run tests within the scope of 
    webapp/manage.py
4. Jobs will pass as long as all tests in the project runs OK, and the
    code itself doesn't crash.
5. If you experience that the tests run OK, and the code doesn't crash locally,
    but the jobs fail on GitLab, it might be for the following reasons(will add
    to this once we face new problems):
    - You have implemented a new module that aren't in the standard Python 
        library. Add it to the requirements.txt file with the correct version.
        (To see what version you are running in your venv, run "pip freeze" in
        the relevant terminal.)
    - The imports you use in your files/tests are only valid locally. Try to 
        mimic the imports in files/tests that still work on the pipeline.
        
Tests can be run in the terminal using this command:
````bash
$ python manage.py test
````
